# Visual Studio 2017 Source + Files

## Short Information
As we already live in 2017 and a lot of people are still using Visual Studio 2003 so I decided to release my "clean" Visual Studio 2017 Source (including database and serverfiles). I suggest using the resource that is included in this release because most of the *.lua files required changes to be compatible with the latest Lua version.

## What do i need to run this?
- [Express x64](https://download.microsoft.com/download/7/9/4/794bfafa-aea7-45d4-a6ea-4e92f09918e3/SQLEXPRWT_x64_ENU.exe)
- [Visual Studio 2017](https://www.visualstudio.com/fr/vs/whatsnew/)

## Changes
* boost has been removed
* Lua was upgraded to version 5.3.3
* Unused projects within the source have been removed
* Cursors are no longer loaded from the project
* The Neuz IP is read from the start parameter of the Neuz.exe
