# Visual Studio 2019-ish Source + Files

## Short Information
This is a rework of Denwo22's first Flyff release. This will contain an updated version of FlyFF. New functionalities or cleaner than clean code might come out of this.

## What I want to do
- Universalize the server
- Ditch DirectX 8 and use 9 at least, or 11.
- Make the code cleaner and more functional.
- Make the database compatible with older versions of SQL Server (WIP)
